      <title>For Iranian Women - برای زنان ایران</title>

      <description>Recent incidents about the deaths of people in Iran are disturbing. Killing, arresting, and threatening people is not how to treat Iran&amp;rsquo;s brave women and men. What a shame to arrest Taraneh Alidoosti, a citizen, mom of a nine-year-old daughter, and award-winning actress.
It is cowardly to shut internet access and block common communication apps aiming to isolate people from each other and the rest of the world. I am deeply upset about the current situation and stand with the people.</description>

      <description>With the plethora of &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;social&amp;rsquo; platforms for microblogging, a need for a personal blog or website seems redundant. I firmly believe in having an independent platform and not relying on ad-promoted giants. A private domain costs a few bucks annually, and hosting a website is easy and quick that can be done locally or on paid servers.
This static website has zero analytics, ads, or other nonsense. It should be responsive and fast on desktop or mobile.</description>
