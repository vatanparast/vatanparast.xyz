      <title>Sorbitol wash of DNA extraction of autumn leaves</title>

      <description>DNA extraction from fresh and young spring leaves is easy using the inexpensive CTAB method or expensive column kits. However, when it comes to DNA extraction from degraded autumn tree leaves, pre-wash before the CTAB step is required to get rid of the secondary compounds, which pass through to the final stages. The results would be genomic DNA contaminated with polysaccharides, polyphenols, etc.
Ulmus autumn leaves I tried TNE (Tris, NaCl, EDTA) buffer as a pre-wash before CTAB for Ulmus species, but DNA was not precipitating well enough after keeping overnight at -20C.</description>

<p>I tried TNE (Tris, NaCl, EDTA) buffer as a pre-wash before CTAB for Ulmus species, but DNA was not precipitating well enough after keeping overnight at -20C. And quality, according to the NanoDrop, was not good either.</p>
<p>Washing with Sorbitol instead of TNE improved the yield and quality of genomic DNA but could have been better. This method is described in detail in the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206085">Inglis et al. 2018</a>. I repeated both washes twice to discard the viscous supernatant.</p>

<p>More compounds (e.g., polysaccharides, polyphenolics) were carried over to this step using TNE compared to Sorbitol. This is visible in the agarose 1% gel images. The ladder is 1 kb.</p>

<p>There is room for improvement, though. If you have to extract DNA from autumn leaves, try sorbitol wash! Other options would be from buds, cambium, or woods.</p>

      <title>For Iranian Women - برای زنان ایران</title>

      <description>Recent incidents about the deaths of people in Iran are disturbing. Killing, arresting, and threatening people is not how to treat Iran&amp;rsquo;s brave women and men. What a shame to arrest Taraneh Alidoosti, a citizen, mom of a nine-year-old daughter, and award-winning actress.
It is cowardly to shut internet access and block common communication apps aiming to isolate people from each other and the rest of the world. I am deeply upset about the current situation and stand with the people.</description>

      <description>With the plethora of &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;social&amp;rsquo; platforms for microblogging, a need for a personal blog or website seems redundant. I firmly believe in having an independent platform and not relying on ad-promoted giants. A private domain costs a few bucks annually, and hosting a website is easy and quick that can be done locally or on paid servers.
This static website has zero analytics, ads, or other nonsense. It should be responsive and fast on desktop or mobile.</description>
