      <description>Recent incidents about the deaths of people in Iran are disturbing. Killing, arresting, and threatening people is not how to treat Iran&amp;rsquo;s brave women and men. What a shame to arrest Taraneh Alidoosti, a citizen, mom, and famous actress. It is cowardly to shut internet access and block common communication apps aiming to isolate people from each other and the rest of the world. I am deeply upset about the current situation and stand with the people.</description>
