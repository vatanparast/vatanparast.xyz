      <description>With the plethora of &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;social&amp;rsquo; platforms for microblogging, a need for a personal blog or website seems redundant. I firmly believe in having an independent platform and not relying on ad-promoted giants. A private domain costs a few bucks annually, and hosting a website is easy and quick; can be done on free or paid servers.
This static website has zero analytics, ads, or other nonsense. So it should be responsive and fast on desktop or mobile.</description>
